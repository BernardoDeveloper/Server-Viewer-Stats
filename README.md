# How to execute

First enable to execute the file

```sh
chmod +x ./server-stats.sh
```

And now we has two forms to execute the script. First to only show the information:

```sh
./server-stats.sh
```

Or you can see the information in real time using the flag `--real-time`

```sh
./server-stats.sh --real-time
```
